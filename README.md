This is a subdomain to host my blog site._<br>
Ideally I'ld like this space to be a kind of an online journal on several endeavours of mine. Time will show how it evolves...

There's [sleeping beauty].

More content will follow in due time. For the time being I've just added a few links for a debian configuration. More will follow.


- macOS notes [macos]
- xubuntu notes [xubuntu]
- Debian notes [debian]
- have a look at the [Bookmarks]
- Θέσεις / Παρα-Θέσεις [blogspot]
- back to [kyriazis.xyz]
